## Introduction

This repository is a showcase of various OpenCV projects developed by [Hadi Agdam](https://github.com/HadiAgdam) and [Real Frankenstein](https://github.com/realfrankenstein). Each project demonstrates different aspects of computer vision, ranging from basic image processing to more complex applications like object detection and face recognition.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine and explore each project directory. Each project contains code, explanations, and examples to help you understand the concepts.

## Installation

Before running any of the projects, you need to set up your Python environment with the necessary dependencies.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HadiAgdam/opencv-projects-showcase.git
cd opencv-projects-showcase
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install the Required Libraries
